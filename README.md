# DotFiles
these are my personal DotFiles for my configuration of window managers, terminals, etc...

# Notice on keyboard layout
as i use colemak my keybinds and hotkeys for programs follow what is comfortable for the colemak layout not qwerty or any other standard layout if you wish to use these dotfiles (there not that good so dont bother probably) be sure to change them
# Color scheme
my configs typically use gruvbox with purple purple as the accent color when possible
# st
uses scrollback, alpha, and anysize patches minimal keybind changes or aditional features currently
# dwm
uses cool autostart for automaticly starting programs, useless gaps for gaps, fibonacci for more comfortable tiling experience swallow to swallow terminal when booting some application ex mpv
